#####Security Mechanisms

- prevent tampering with the transaction that take place between a CPE and ACS
- provide confidentiality for these transaction 
- allow various levels of authentication

The following security mechanisms are incorporated in this protocol:

- SSL/TLS 
- HTTP layer

######Security initialization Models




#####Connection Establishment

######CPE Connection Initiation

issue the Inform RPC

######ACS Connection Initiation

using the Connection Request notification mechanism

If the CPE is behind a firewall or NAT device lying between the ACS and CPE,the ACS may not be able to access the CPE at all,only CPE connection initiation is possiable.

#####Authentication

If the CPE is not authenticated using SSL/TLS,the ACS must authenticate the CPE using HTTP.

- SSL/TLS for encrytion,then use either basic or digest authentication
- SSL/TLS not being used,the use digest authentication
